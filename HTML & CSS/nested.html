		<p>Introduction: Cascading with CSS</p>
		<div>
			<p>Synopsis: When you set a property of a selector like 'p' to a certain value, that value applies to <em>all</em> p tags.
			If, however, you change that same property to a different value for a more specific instance of p,
			that change will <em>override</em> the 'general rule'.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>If you say p { font-family: Garamond}, all 'p's will have the font Garamond.</p></li>
				<li><p>BUT if you say li p {font-family: Verdana}, 'p's outside of 'li's will be
					   in Garamond, and 'p's INSIDE 'li's will be in Verdana.
				</p></li>
				<li><p>The more specific your selectors are, the higher importance CSS gives to the styling you apply!</p></li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<p>Summary: Greater specificity makes CSS prioritize that particular styling.</p>

<!--
	Remember, you can reach an element that is a child of another element like this:

	div div p { /* Some CSS */ }
	where in this case, we'd be grabbing any <p> that is nested somewhere inside a <div> that is nested somewhere inside another <div>. If you want to grab direct children—that is, an element that is directly nested inside another element, with no elements in between—you can use the > symbol, like so:

	div > p { /* Some CSS */ }
	This only grabs <p>s that are nested directly inside of <div>s; it won't grab any paragraphs that are, say, nested inside lists that are in turn nested inside <div>s.
